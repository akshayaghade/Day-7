#Create a function covid() & it should accept patient name, and body temperature, by default the body temperature should be 98 degree

        print("Patient Name is ",patient name," Body Temperature is ",default)
    else:
        print("Patient Name is ",patient name," Body Temperature is",body temperature)
covid("Akshay","")
covid("Akshay","99")

Patient Name is Akshay Body Temperature is 98
Patient Name is Akshay Body Temperature  is 99
